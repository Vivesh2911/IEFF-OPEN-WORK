				<p class="wow fadeInUp">The Taj Mahal meaning "Crown of the Palaces" is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of 
				Agra, one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mugal emperor , Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), 
				to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Muntaz Mahal , a Persian princess who died giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum. The imperial court documenting 
				Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal. It also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan, 
				the builder. The tomb is the centerpiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three 
				sides by a crenellated wall.
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-lg-12">
				<p class="wow fadeInUp">The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, 
				Ustad Ahmad Lahouri. Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. 
				The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 
				would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (US $ 827 millions).
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-12">
				<p class="wow fadeInUp">The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site  in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally 
				admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. 
				The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year, it was declared a winner of the NEW 7Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.

			<div class="col-lg-12">
				<p class="wow fadeInUp">The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognized 
				architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect. 
				The color combination of lush green scape reddish pathway and blue sky over it show cases the monument in ever changing tints and moods. 
				The relief work in marble and inlay with precious and semi precious stones make it a monument apart.
			</div>			
			<div class="col-lg-12">
				<p class="wow fadeInUp">The uniqueness of Taj Mahal lies in some truly remarkable innovations carried out by the horticulture planners and architects of Shah Jahan. 
				One such genius planning is the placing of tomb at one end of the quadripartite garden rather than in the exact centre, which added rich depth and perspective to 
				the distant view of the monument. It is also, one of the best examples of raised tomb variety. The tomb is further raised on a square platform with the four sides 
				of the octagonal base of the minarets extended beyond the square at the corners. 
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-lg-12">
				<p class="wow fadeInUp">	
				The top of the platform is reached through a lateral flight of steps provided 
				in the centre of the southern side. The ground plan of the Taj Mahal is in perfect balance of composition, the octagonal tomb chamber in the centre, encompassed 
				by the portal halls and the four corner rooms. The plan is repeated on the upper floor. The exterior of the tomb is square in plan, with chamfered corners.

			<div class="col-lg-12">
				<p class="wow fadeInUp">The large double storied domed chamber, which houses the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan, is a perfect octagon in plan. 
				The exquisite octagonal marble lattice screen encircling both cenotaphs is a piece of superb workmanship. It is highly polished and richly decorated with inlay work. 
				The borders of the frames are inlaid with precious stones representing flowers executed with wonderful perfection. 
			</div>	
			
			<div class="col-lg-12">
				<p class="wow fadeInUp">The hues and the shades of the stones used to make the leaves and the flowers appear almost real. The cenotaph of Mumtaz Mahal is in perfect centre of the tomb chamber, placed on a rectangular platform decorated 
				with inlaid flower plant motifs. The cenotaph of Shah Jahan is greater than Mumtaz Mahal and installed more than thirty years later by the side of the latter on its west. 
				The upper cenotaphs are only illusory and the real graves are in the lower tomb chamber (crypt), a practice adopted in the imperial Mughal tombs.
