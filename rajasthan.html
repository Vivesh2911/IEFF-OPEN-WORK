				<p class="wow fadeInUp">Jaipur is the capital of India’s Rajasthan state. It evokes the royal family that once ruled the region and that, in 1727, founded what is now called the Old City, or “Pink City” for its trademark building color. The story goes that in 1876, the Prince of Wales visited India on a tour. Since the color pink was symbolic of hospitality, Maharaja Ram Singh of Jaipur painted the entire city pink. The pink that colors the city makes for a marvellous spectacle to behold. At the center of its stately street grid (notable in India) stands the opulent, colonnaded City Palace complex. With gardens, courtyards and museums, part of it is still a royal residence.</p>
			</div>
			
		<div class="col-lg-12">
				<p class="wow fadeInUp">The city has a very rich and 5000 year's old history that starts with the arrival of the Pandavas. The city is also a witness of the different wars particularly the Indian war of independence. It was made the capital of the nation by the Britishers.Planned by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya, Jaipur holds the distinction of being the first planned city of India.Renowned globally for its coloured gems, the capital city of Rajasthan combines the allure of its ancient history with all the advantages of a metropolis. The bustling modern city is one of the three corners of the golden triangle that includes Delhi, Agra and Jaipur.</p>

			 <h4 class="heading5" style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;">Jaipur Culture at a Glance...........</h4>
				
			<div class="col-lg-12">	
				<p class="wow fadeInUp">With grand palaces, historic city walls and buzzing streets, Jaipur, aka the Pink City (named for the color of the buildings at its historic centre), is the perfect stop as part of a larger North India tour. It’s the most complex and largest of the cities in Rajasthan, though it’s perfectly possible to navigate solo or as part of a small group. Its modern offerings, juxtaposed with centuries-old institutions and bazaars, make it a haven for design junkies and foodies. Experience the boom in contemporary cafes and bars and upscale textile and clothing boutiques – and leave room in your luggage for bargain and luxury finds.</p>
			</div>
		
			<h4 class="heading5" style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;">Entry Gates of the City:</h4>
			
			<div class="col-lg-12">
				<p class="wow fadeInUp">Apart from its rich culture and royal heritage, Jaipur is also famous for the old city gates which are also known as Jaipur gates are hard to miss. These gates marked the outer periphery of Jaipur city as laid out by Maharajah Sawai Jai Singh IIduring the founding of this city in 1727 AD. As per the plan, a 6-meter high and 3-meter thick wall surrounded Jaipur, containing the city within. This wall acted as a security feature, protecting the city its inhabitants from any outside threats like attacking armies, wild animals, and dacoits etc.</p>
			</div>
		
			<div class="col-lg-12">
				<p class="wow fadeInUp">Any movement in and out of the city was routed through these gates. Initially, the city was protected by 8 gates in all four directions. These gates would close at dusk and open only after dawn. To alarm all citizens in the evening about the impending closure of gates, a small cannon would be fired in a similar fashion to the sounding of bells. Today, these gates are merely symbolic; part of city’s history, Nostalgia and built heritage. However, they are also an important element of Jaipur’s rich architectural legacy for which city is famous across the world.</p>

		 	<p>The Amber (pronounced Amer) is at a distance of about 11 kilometres from Jaipur. Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it was the bastion of the Kachwahas of Amber, until the capital was moved to the plains, to what is today Jaipur. The palace, located in craggy hills, is a beautiful melange of Hindu and Mughal styles. Raja Man Singh I began construction in 1592 and the palace, which was built as a strong, safe haven against attacking enemies, was completed by Mirja Raja Jai Singh. The contrast between the harsh exterior and the inviting interior couldn’t be more surprising. Made entirely of red sandstone and white marble, visitors are left spellbound by the magnificence of the palace that utilises carvings, precious stones and mirrors. The splendour of the palace is enhanced by the breath-taking vista of the Maota Lake in front. The palace is nearly seven centuries old and has a legendary past. Originally a small structure that the Rajputs won from the Meena tribes, it was later transformed into the grand Amber Palace.</p>

				<p>Located deep within the walled city, the City Palace Complex was conceived and built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur. A beautiful fusion of Mughal and Rajput architecture, the palace is still home to the last ruling royal family which lives in a private section of the palace. Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II is credited with building most of the structures, but it was expanded upon by later rulers as well. The City Palace Complex includes the Mubarak Mahal (the palace of reception) and the Maharani’s Palace (the palace of the queen). Mubarak Mahal now houses the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum and displays a vast and unique collection of royal costumes, delicate Pashmina (Kashmiri) shawls, Benaras silk saris, and other dresses with Sanganeri prints and folk embroidery. The clothes of Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh I are also on display. The Maharani's Palace, surprisingly, has an interesting display of very well-preserved Rajput weaponry, some dating back to the 15th century. Other than the arms, the palace is adorned with beautiful paintings on the ceiling that are well-maintained.</p>

				<p>Hawa Mahal, literally the Palace of Winds, was built in 1799 by the poet king Sawai Pratap Singh as a summer retreat for him and his family. It also served as a place where the ladies of the royal household could observe everyday life without being seen themselves. This unique five-storey structure is a blend of Hindu and Islamic architecture, and the exterior, with its small latticed windows (called jharokhas), resembles the crown of Lord Krishna. The windows also serve as an air-conditioner of sorts, blowing cool air throughout the palace, making it the perfect retreat during summers. Built from pink sandstone, the Hawa Mahal is Jaipur’s iconic landmark and visitors can view its complete magnificence from outside, from across the road. However, it is also possible to climb right up to the top for a wonderful view from the windows. Today, the Mahal is maintained by the Archaeological Department of the Government of Rajasthan and also houses an archaeological museum in the courtyard.</p>

It was constructed during the reign of Jai Singh in 1734, and was later expanded in 1868. Nahargarh, which means abode of tigers, was a formidable barrier, defending Jaipur against attacking enemies. Within its walls, the fort houses Madhavendra Bhawan, the summer destination for the members of the royal family. Built by Sawai Madho Singh, the palace has 12 matching boudoirs for the queens, at the head of which is a suite for the king. They are all connected by corridors decorated with delicate murals. Even today the palace is a favoured spot for local picnickers. The fort looks brilliant when floodlit at night. Overlooking the city, it presents a glittering view of the city lights.</p>
